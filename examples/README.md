# Examples #

This folder contains two kinds of folders

- `examples/example_*`: contains an example _before_ running `phpytex run` within it.
- `examples/expected_*`: contains the corresponding expected output.

Each such pairs of folders demonstrates what Phpytex can do.

## Manual test the examples ##

To test out the examples for yourself, proceed as follows:

1. Ensure that you have installed Phpytex (see [install/README.md](./../install/README.md)).

2. Copy the examples folders or clone the entire repository.

3. Run phpytex within any `example_*` folder of choice.

4. Compare the outcome with the corresponding `expected_*` folder.
